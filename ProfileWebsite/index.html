      <h2>MS Coding Academy Testimony</h2>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Joining the MS Coding Academy truly changed the trajectory of my life. I came into the program with hope, eager to learn new skills and transition into the tech world. I developed technical skills in coding, web development, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies. Along the way, I built confidence, discovered a new passion, and felt like I was finally stepping into purpose.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">But it wasn't a smooth ride. At one point, I seriously considered quitting. Life's challenges felt overwhelming, and I mentally checked out. Although I knew the immense benefits of embracing coding, AI, and web development—especially in creating innovative solutions in education—I lost the zeal to keep pushing. The weight of personal struggles dimmed the fire I once had.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Then came March 28, 2025—the day of the Interdisciplinary AI Symposiumm, hosted by Jackson State University. That presentation reignited something in me. Seeing real-world applications of tech across different sectors, especially education, reminded me of why I started. I realized that coding and web development aren’t just skills—they’re tools of transformation. I saw clearly how I could use these tools to make a real impact in classrooms, empower learners, and bridge gaps in education.</p>
        
        
    <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">The MS Coding Academy gave me more than technical training—it gave me community, hands-on experience, and a renewed sense of purpose. I now know that even in moments of doubt, there’s always a reason to keep going. And for me, that reason is clear: to innovate, to empower, and to transform lives through tech.</p>
